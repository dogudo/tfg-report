It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The scrum team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called daily scrums (a form of stand-up meeting). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve.},

	abstract = {Kanban (Japanese: 看板(Chinese Character reused by Japanese), meaning signboard or billboard) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing (also called just-in-time manufacturing, abbreviated JIT). Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory. Kanban is also known as the Toyota nameplate system in the automotive industry.
Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement. Problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process and process steps. One of the main benefits of kanban is to establish an upper limit to work in process inventory to avoid overcapacity. Other systems with similar effect exist, for example CONWIP.  A systematic study of various configurations of kanban systems, such as Generalized Kanban or Production Authorization Card (PAC) and Extended Kanban, of which CONWIP is an important special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), and more recently Liberopoulos and Dallery (2000), among other papers.A goal of the kanban system is to limit the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. Limits on the number of items waiting at supply points are established and then reduced as inefficiencies are identified and removed. Whenever a limit is exceeded, this points to an inefficiency that should be addressed.},

	doi = {10.13140/RG.2.1.1349.4880},
	abstract = {We propose a novel method for binarization of color documents whereby the foreground text is output as black and the background as white regardless of the polarity of foreground-background shades. The method employs an edge-based connected component approach and automatically determines a threshold for each component. It has several advantages over existing binarization methods. Firstly, it can handle documents with multi-colored texts with different background shades. Secondly, the method is applicable to documents having text of widely varying sizes, usually not handled by local binarization methods. Thirdly, the method automatically computes the threshold for binarization and the logic for inverting the output from the image data and does not require any input parameter. The proposed method has been applied to a broad domain of target document types and environment and is found to have a good adaptability.
NB: The Matlab source code for our binarization algorithm is available for free download, both from Research Gate (MILE Matlab code for text binarization in complex color images) and from our lab server at: http://mile.ee.iisc.ernet.in/mile/download.html},

The number of Muslims in Korea who are in the minority results in the Korean people's understanding of halal food being very minimal. As a result, foreign tourists, especially Muslim tourists who come to Korea have difficulty choosing halal food.
Based on these problems, the topic of this research is based on the image processing system (Image Processing) that is designed is the detection of the letters of the alphabet and Hangul (Korean characters) using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Raspberry Pi as data processing so that it can recognize letter characters Hangul and alphabet that are already available in the database. The workings of this system are first to create a database of food data and certain words related to food menus. Then by using the Pi camera, scanning of the food menu is done. The data obtained will be processed by Raspberry Pi so that the system is able to detect food menus correctly.
The results show that the system is able to detect food menus from text localization with an average accuracy rate of 88,333\%. By using 4 different font types, the English text shows OCR data train still needs to be improved.},

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is divided into preprocessing, recognition and post-processing. In the preprocessing process, the characters are extracted using Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER). In recognition process, Tesseract-OCR, a free OCR engine, is used to recognize characters. In the post-processing process, the wrong result is corrected by using the dictionary DB for the food menu. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted to compare the recognition performance using the actual menu plate as the DB. The recognition rate measurement experiment with OCR Instantly Free, Text Scanner and Text Fairy, which is a character recognizing application in Google Play Store, was conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed method shows an average recognition rate of 14.1\% higher than other techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a scalar or quantitative measure of the ‘distance’ between English and a myriad of other (non-native American) languages. This measure is based on the difficulty Americans have learning other languages. The linguistic distance measure is then used in an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among adult immigrants in the USA and Canada. It is shown that, when other determinants of English language proficiency are the same, the greater the measure of linguistic distance, the poorer is the respondent’s English language proficiency. This measure can be used in research, evaluation and practitioner analyses, and for diagnostic purposes regarding linguistic minorities in Englishspeaking countries. The methodology can also be applied to develop linguistic distance measures for other languages.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that the prevalence of food allergy has been increasing in recent decades, particularly in westernised countries, yet high-quality evidence that is based on challenge confirmed diagnosis of food allergy to support this assumption is lacking because of the high cost and potential risks associated with conducting food challenges in large populations. Accepting this caveat, the use of surrogate markers for diagnosis of food allergy (such as nationwide data on hospital admissions for food anaphylaxis or clinical history in combination with allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) measurement in population-based cohorts) has provided consistent evidence for increasing prevalence of food allergy at least in western countries, such as the UK, United States and Australia. Recent reports that children of East Asian or African ethnicity who are raised in a western environment (Australia and United States respectively) have an increased risk of developing food allergy compared with resident Caucasian children suggest that food allergy might also increase across Asian and African countries as their economies grow and populations adopt a more westernised lifestyle. Given that many cases of food allergy persist, mathematical principles would predict a continued increase in food allergy prevalence in the short to medium term until such time as an effective treatment is identified to allow the rate of disease resolution to be equal to or greater than the rate of new cases.},

	abstract = {Eight years after the economic crisis began in Spain (2008), its impact on migration trends is due for re-examination. The emigration of young Southern Europeans during the crisis, motivated by high unemployment and the lack of opportunities, has been analysed by various academics. These scholars have highlighted the modification of migration patterns in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, countries with a positive net migration rate during the years of economic growth, and have studied the reversion to their former status as net emigration countries during the recession. However, despite the fact that today, eight years after the onset of the crisis, the economy has begun to show signs of recovery, there is evidence that migration trends among young Spaniards have changed. Consequently, the main hypothesis of this paper is that Spanish migration patterns have been altered by a tendency towards higher mobility at the dawn of the post-crisis era.},
